<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---</h2><p>A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a <em>passphrase</em> instead of simply a pass<em>word</em>. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.</p>
<p>To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aa bb cc dd ee</code> is valid.</li>
<li><code>aa bb cc dd aa</code> is not valid - the word <code>aa</code> appears more than once.</li>
<li><code>aa bb cc dd aaa</code> is valid - <code>aa</code> and <code>aaa</code> count as different words.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. <em>How many passphrases are valid?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>383</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Part Two ---</h2><p>For added security, <span title="Because as everyone knows, the number of rules is proportional to the level of security.">yet another system policy</span> has been put in place.  Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>abcde fghij</code> is a valid passphrase.</li>
<li><code>abcde xyz ecdab</code> is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.</li>
<li><code>a ab abc abd abf abj</code> is a valid passphrase, because <em>all</em> letters need to be used when forming another word.</li>
<li><code>iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo</code> is valid.</li>
<li><code>oiii ioii iioi iiio</code> is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this new system policy, <em>how many passphrases are valid?</em></p>
